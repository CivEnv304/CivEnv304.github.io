### Introduction

This website has resources to carry out Economic Input-Output (environmental and social) Lifecycle Assessments(EIO-LCA) of goods and services.  It is envisioned as a resource for students and analysts to carry out these analyses. The website includes video tutorials, examples, computational tools, and other resources developed for Northwestern University's [CivEnv 304: Civil & Environmental Engineering Systems Analysis](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/academics/courses/descriptions/304.html). We are grateful for funding provided by VentureWell, which provided partial support to the student researchers, Allie Holmgren and Jing Yu.


### Background on Environmental LCAs
We provide a video that introduces Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) method, explaining how they measure the social, environmental, and economic impacts of products and services. The purpose is to provide a conceptual understanding of these assessments and their complexities, preparing viewers for performing LCAs and implementing the computational resource provided in this website.

Readers might refer to the [VentureWell website](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/measuring-sustainability/) for more background information, resources and examples about LCA,

### LCA computational resources
We provide a demonstration video about the details of performing EIO-LCA using a t-shirt example. It aims to provide knowledges about how to calculate and interpret the economic and environmental impacts of manufacturing, transportation, and retailing, using provided tools and resources.

### Student projects

We provide several student projects that use the EIO-LCA tool from [2024SP_CIV_ENV_304](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/academics/courses/descriptions/304.html) as examples of applications of this LCA computational tool.
